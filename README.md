2048 Game using Reactjs

<a href="https://akki199421.github.io/2048-react" target="_blank">Demo</a>

An implementation of the game 2048 using React JS. Choose a grid size and start playing. The goal is to make a tile of 2048 value, but you can continue untill the game is over. The game stores your current status state in a local storage so you can continue from where you left off. Use the arrow keys to move the tiles.


P.S. : The game is still a work in progress. Animations are not added yet.
